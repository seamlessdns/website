        <h1>Invest where interoperability becomes economic value.</h1>
        <p>
          The organization implementing an operation and the organization capturing its value are not always the same. Seamless gives participants a way to share implementation costs while each benefits through activation, distribution, retention, operational efficiency, trust, or new commercial opportunity.

        <h2>Value by operation category</h2>
        <p>
          Seamless begins with Domain Connect because it is proven and ready for standards-track adoption. The project is protocol agnostic and will use the open mechanism best suited to each additional operation category.
        </p>
        <div className={styles.transactionList}>

          <h2>The buildout determines whether the neutral layer exists.</h2>
          <p>
            Sponsors provide the concentrated capital needed to establish production infrastructure, provider-supported integrations, reusable coordination capabilities, and ecosystem adoption. Once the service reaches scale, transparent operating fees can sustain it at a lower marginal cost than repeatedly rebuilding or licensing the same foundations.
          </p>
        </aside>

        <h2>Protocol choice and commercial opportunity remain open</h2>
        <p>
          Seamless is infrastructure, not a mandated protocol or end-user product. Operation categories may use Domain Connect, other standards, or new open interfaces where needed. Organizations may use the shared layer directly or build commercial services on top of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Embedded experiences, enterprise support, monitoring, analytics, security, orchestration, and service-level commitments remain areas for vigorous competition. <strong>The common coordination layer should be neutral; differentiation should happen above it.</strong>
